# Python Examples 
 ## The repository consists some of the building blocks of python. The codes are properly indented and are user friendly. The files contain some of the fundamental topics of learning Python while there are also two files('rock_paper_scissors.py' and 'Blackjack,py') where I applied my existing skills to create two popular games. 
 
## _Blackjack.py_ : The final project is the Blackjack game where I used OOP and other python fundamental knowledge to create a interactive Blackjack game with the computer.
